# Arduino Project ArduSDR

This is my Arduino sketch for a Software Defined Radio, using an **Elektor SDR Shield 2.0** connected to an **Arduino Uno**. The SDR shield was released in Elektor Magazine 7/2018 with some basic firmware and you can buy it in the Elektor Shop. Only few SDR programs support the original command set on the serial interface, e.g. [G8JCFSDR](https://www.g8jcf.uk/). Meanwhile the firmware had some improvements, but it is still very basic and has its limitations. Therefore, I wrote my own software for fun and added a few useful functions:

+ A subset of the well documented **Yaesu FT-991 CAT serial protocol** is used instead of the proprietary serial protocol from Elektor. This allows you to control the SDR hardware by more SDR programs on Windows PCs, on Linux PCs or on Macs.
+ A standard **2 lines by 16 characters LCD** is used for displaying useful information about the status of the SDR. The display is connected via an IÂ²C interface.
+ A **rotary encoder** can be used to change the RX frequency as in commercial amateur radio transceivers.
+ *TODO*: A **numeric 4 x 4 keypad** can be used to enter the RX frequency directly. The keypad needs only one analog input pin on the Arduino.

## Used Libraries

+ [Etherkit Si5351](https://github.com/etherkit/Si5351Arduino) version 2.1.4 by Jason Milldrum
+ [LiquidCrystal I2C](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C) version 1.1.2 by Marco Schwartz
+ [Encoder](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html) version 1.4.2 by Paul Stoffregen
+ *TODO*: [Analog Keypad](https://github.com/AndrewMascolo/OnewireKeypad) version 0.0.0 by Andrew Mascolo

## Ideas for Future Development

+ Integrated WSPR encoding and modulation
+ Morse code encoder and decoder
+ RTTY encoder and decoder
